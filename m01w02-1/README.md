# M01W02 - Objects in JS

### To Do
- [x] Review primitive types
- [x] Objects!
- [x] Passing primitives and objects to functions
- [x] Functions inside objects (using `this`)
- [x] Object iteration with `for..in`

### Primitive Type
* the building blocks of the language
* non-objects
* stored directly in memory (RAM)
* cannot be changed after they are created (immutable)

### 7 Primitive Types
* string
* number
* null
* boolean
* undefined

* symbol
* bigint

### Objects
* arrays
* objects
* functions


* objects => represent a thing
* arrays => collections of things

const cohort = [{}, {}, {}]



* primitives => "passed by value" which means it gets a copy
* objects => "passed by reference" which means it gets the original
