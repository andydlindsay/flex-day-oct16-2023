# M01W03 - TDD, CommonJS, and NPM

### To Do
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Making assertions
- [x] Bringing in outside code
- [x] Exporting our code
- [x] Intro to NPM: a Node package manager
- [x] Mocha test runner
- [x] Ignoring files/folders
- [x] Chai assertion library
- [x] What is TDD?

### Assertion Library
* assertion => forceful statement of fact or belief
* write expectations about values
* if the assertion fails, it throws an error

### Node
* a runtime for JS
* what runs our code
* C++ app
* V8 Engine
* add a bunch of modules/functionality

### CommonJS
* CJS
* module.exports and require

### NPM Install Commands

```bash
$ npm install name-of-package # installs as a dependency
$ npm install --save-dev name-of-package # installs as a dev dependency
$ npm install --global name-of-package # installs globally on operating system
```

### Test-Driven Development
* tests are written BEFORE the code is written
* n-Driven Development
